# Sequence Models in TinyML

This repository explores optimizing sequence models like **RNN, LSTM, and GRU** for **TinyML applications**. The goal is to downsize these models while maintaining performance and efficiency.

## 🚀 Project Overview <br>
- Compare **RNN, LSTM, and GRU** architectures in terms of accuracy, loss, and inference time.
- Optimize models for **TinyML deployment** using **TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) and ONNX**.
- Evaluate trade-offs between **performance and model size**.

As the project progresses, we will:<br>
✅ Compare RNN, LSTM, and GRU on benchmark datasets.<br>
✅ Optimize models for low-memory and low-power devices.<br>
✅ Convert and deploy models using TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) and ONNX.<br>
✅ Evaluate inference time, accuracy, and model size trade-offs.<br>
